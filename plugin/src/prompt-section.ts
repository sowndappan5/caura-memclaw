/**
 * MemClaw Memory Prompt Section Builder
 *
 * Produces the system-prompt fragment that is injected on every turn
 * via the OpenClaw memory-prompt-section API. Two consumers:
 *
 *   1. registerMemoryPromptSection  — native path (requires kind:"memory")
 *   2. before_prompt_build hook     — fallback for older OpenClaw versions
 *
 * Per-turn token budget: this fragment is paid on every model call. The
 * deep reference (three rules, write triggers, capture cadence, quality,
 * prohibitions, per-tool signatures) lives in `skills/memclaw/SKILL.md`
 * and is loaded on demand via the skill `read` path. The per-workspace
 * `TOOLS.md` and `AGENTS.md` carry the slim every-turn cues. This file
 * is intentionally minimal: a header, the available tool list, the
 * non-negotiable identity reminder, and a pointer to SKILL.md.
 *
 * On hosts that do NOT bootstrap-inject TOOLS.md / AGENTS.md, this
 * fragment is the agent's only direct prompt-time signal that MemClaw
 * exists; the agent is still expected to read SKILL.md before its
 * first MemClaw call to pick up the operating contract.
