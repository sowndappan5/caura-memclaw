/**
 * Plugin-side skill reconciler — Phase A of the skills-as-documents
 * migration.
 *
 * On every heartbeat, mirror the visible ``collection=skills`` catalog
 * onto ``<target>/<slug>/SKILL.md`` on local disk. Replaces the dropped
 * ``install_skill`` / ``uninstall_skill`` fleet commands (which were
 * Phase B's removed push-mode behaviour).
 *
 * Targets: by default the reconciler converges the plugin's own skills
 * dir (``getPluginDir()/skills``) in ``owned`` mode. Additional targets
 * can be configured via ``MEMCLAW_SKILL_TARGETS`` (see
 * {@link resolveSkillTargets}). Two modes:
 *   - ``owned`` ({@link reconcileOwnedDir}): the dir is fully
 *     MemClaw-managed; any on-disk skill not in the catalog is pruned
 *     (except {@link PROTECTED_SKILLS}).
 *   - ``additive`` ({@link reconcileAdditiveDir}): a shared/foreign dir.
 *     MemClaw only ever touches entries it wrote, tracked per-skill via
 *     the {@link OWNED_MARKER} sentinel — foreign skills are never
 *     overwritten (collisions are skipped) or removed.
 * With no config, the single default ``owned`` target makes behaviour
 * byte-identical to before targets were configurable.
 *
 * Properties:
 *
 * - **Declarative**: the catalog row IS the source of truth; the
 *   reconciler only converges the on-disk view.
 * - **Self-healing**: missed heartbeats catch up on the next tick.
 *   No queue, no "lost install command" failure mode.
 * - **Idempotent**: re-running is a no-op when disk already matches.
 * - **Server-gated catalog**: the reconciler pulls from
 *   ``/skills/installable``, which applies ALL policy server-side —
 *   tenant + fleet visibility AND (for Skill-Factory-opted-in tenants)
 *   the active-only lifecycle gate. So the reconciler carries no opt-in
 *   flag and no status filter: skills the server returns → on disk;
 *   anything it withholds (a sibling fleet's skill, or a candidate /
 *   staged / quarantined skill on an opted-in tenant) → never on disk.
 *   This is the SAME gate the MCP pull surface enforces (PR #315), so
 *   push (this reconciler) and pull (memclaw_doc) agree on what an agent
 *   may see. A skill flipping active→rejected/quarantined drops out of
 *   the catalog and is removed from disk on the next tick (owned mode).
 *
 * Failure mode: fail open. If the catalog query throws or the server
 * returns non-2xx (network, server, schema, or the fail-closed 503 the
 * install surface raises during a settings outage), the reconciler logs
 * and returns; existing on-disk skills are preserved untouched and
 * nothing new is written — so an outage can never push a non-active
 * skill to disk. The heartbeat loop continues.
