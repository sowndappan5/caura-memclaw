"""A9 — type classifier confuses ``action`` and ``episode``.

Gap: 28 of ~95 misclassifications are ``action``-class; ``action``
accounts for 30% of all type errors. Root cause: the enrichment
prompt distinguishes neither dimension cleanly between

  - **action** — the actor's own completed deed (past tense first-
    person: "I deployed", "filed", "merged", "sent"). Subject is
    typically the agent itself.

  - **episode** — an observed event tied to time/place that the
    actor witnessed or recorded (third-person: "the deployment
    failed", "the meeting concluded", "outage between 14:00 and
    14:30"). Subject is the event, not the agent.

Fix: 2-3 contrastive few-shot pairs in the enrichment prompt + a
sharpened type description so the LLM has explicit guidance on the
dimension that disambiguates them. No schema change.
