"""Tests for core_api.services.audit_queue (CAURA-628).

Covers the in-memory queue + background flusher behaviours that
``log_action`` relies on:

- enqueue is non-blocking and triggers a flush when the threshold is
  reached
- the interval timer also triggers a flush even if the threshold
  hasn't been hit (steady-state low-volume tenants)
- shutdown drains pending events
- queue overflow drops + warns rather than blocking the request hot
  path
- flush failures don't kill the loop
