"""Canonical topic names as str-valued enum members.

Convention: `memclaw.<domain>.<verb-past-participle>` for events that
announce something that already happened, `.<verb-requested>` for events
that ask a subscriber to do work.

Uses `enum.StrEnum` (Python 3.11+) so members behave like the underlying
string in every context: equality, dict-key hashing, f-string formatting,
and Pub/Sub `topic_path` building all see `Topics.Memory.CREATED` as
the literal `"memclaw.memory.created"`. A plain `(str, enum.Enum)` mix
equates but does NOT format as the value — `f"{M.X}"` returns
`"M.X"` — which would corrupt any string-formatted use site.
