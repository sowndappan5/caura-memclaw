"""LLM-provider Protocol — moved from ``core_api.protocols`` (CAURA-595).

Async LLM provider interface for structured-JSON + free-text completions.
The same Protocol is consumed by ``common.enrichment.service`` (via
``get_llm_provider`` factory) and by core-api code paths that pre-date
the extraction (which keep working via the re-export at
``core_api.protocols.LLMProvider``).

Mirrors the embedding-provider extraction (CAURA-594 Step B): keep the
shared Protocol in ``common`` so both core-api and core-worker can import
it without the worker pulling in core_api as a dependency.
