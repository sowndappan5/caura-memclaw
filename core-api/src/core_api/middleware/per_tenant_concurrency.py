"""Per-tenant in-flight concurrency caps — two-layer bulkhead.

The slowapi-based ``rate_limit`` middleware bounds request *rate*. A
single tenant burst can still occupy every worker slot in a container
and starve other tenants — exactly the noisy-neighbor pattern the
loadtest harness flagged.

Two caps compose:

1. **Route-entry slot** (``"write"`` / ``"search"``, PR #33). Held for
   the whole request lifecycle — embed + enrich + storage. Acquire
   timeout is short (``per_tenant_acquire_timeout_seconds`` ≈ 50ms);
   fails fast with 429 so a saturated tenant can't queue forever.
   Bounds end-to-end concurrency.

2. **Storage-call slot** (``"storage_write"`` / ``"storage_search"``,
   CAURA-602 follow-up). Held only across the storage roundtrip itself.
   Acquire is unbounded — the outer request budget already caps how
   long the wait can run, and queueing here is the *intended* shape
   (a tenant in the embed phase doesn't hold a storage connection).
   Bounds storage-pool occupancy per tenant — keeps a hot tenant from
   parking every storage-writer connection on a 20-item bulk while
   tenant B waits to write a single row.

State is per-process. With cap ``N`` and Cloud Run ``max_instances``
``M``, the fleet-wide cap is ``N * M`` — size in concert with
``containerConcurrency`` and the storage-writer pool size.
