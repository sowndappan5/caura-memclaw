# the plugin can't self-detect (persistent /plugin-source fetch errors,
# unsafe-filename manifest aborts) and — most insidiously — when a deploy
# "succeeds" but the served manifest version sits below MIN_RECOMMENDED,

# deploys for the same target within AUTO_UPGRADE_ATTEMPT_WINDOW the gate
# stops queuing and logs a warning for operator follow-up.
#
# A healthy upgrade converges in ONE attempt — the next heartbeat reports
# the new version and the gate exits at the ``_semver_lt`` check before
# this budget is ever consulted — so the budget is invisible to
# legitimate upgrades. 5 attempts absorbs transient flakiness (a one-off
