"""DetectNearDuplicate — A21 advisory dedup signal on the fast write path.

Strong-mode writes run ``CheckSemanticDuplicate`` and 409-reject on a high-
similarity candidate. Default (fast / auto) writes skip semantic dedup
entirely — by design, so callers who want low-latency writes don't pay
the dedup round-trip + the LLM-judge call. But that left the asymmetry
A21 surfaced: an agent that calls in default-mode and re-states the same
fact twice ends up with two independent rows, no signal to the caller
that a near-duplicate already exists.

This step is the *advisory* twin of ``CheckSemanticDuplicate``. It runs
only on fast-mode writes, against the JUDGE band threshold (similarity ≥
``SEMANTIC_DEDUP_JUDGE_THRESHOLD = 0.85``) — wider than the strong-side
auto-reject band (``SEMANTIC_DEDUP_AUTO_THRESHOLD = 0.97``) so it catches
real paraphrases (which typically sit at cosine 0.85-0.94 once you
strip the surface lexical match) without invoking the LLM judge that
the strong path runs above this threshold. Cost: one storage round-trip
per fast write, no LLM. On hit, it stashes the candidate id on the
in-flight ``metadata`` dict (where dedup decision metadata already
lives — see ``check_semantic_duplicate.py`` for the established keys):

  metadata["near_duplicate_of"]          = "<uuid of nearest stored row>"
  metadata["near_duplicate_similarity"]  = <cosine similarity float>

The write is NOT rejected — callers continue to get a 201. They can
read the metadata back on the response to decide whether to undo, merge,
or accept the duplicate. False positives are tolerable because the
signal is advisory: an agent that mis-treats a non-duplicate as one
just loses one row's worth of context, whereas a strong-mode 409 on a
non-duplicate would have hard-rejected a legitimate write — the
LLM-judge gate exists for exactly that asymmetry, and we deliberately
skip it on the fast path. Strong-mode's 409 contract is unchanged.
