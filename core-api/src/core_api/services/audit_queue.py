"""In-memory audit-event queue + background batched flusher (CAURA-628).

Pre-CAURA-628 every memory write triggered a fire-and-forget background
task that POSTed one audit event to ``core-storage-api``. Under bulk
storms (100-item batches x tenant A's 20-concurrent storm = up to 2000
audit POSTs in flight) those calls saturated the storage-api per-tenant
slot AND piled up on the AlloyDB ``audit_log`` table-level write lock,
queueing tenant B's gentle audit traffic behind tenant A's fan-out.
That cross-tenant queueing is the residual contention the CAURA-627
deep-dive identified as the dominant remaining ``noisy-neighbor-write``
cause, after the LLM-pool fix in #34 and the dead-index drop in #35.

This module replaces the per-event POST with an in-memory ``asyncio``
queue + a background flusher that batches events and writes them to a
new ``POST /audit-logs/bulk`` endpoint. Flush triggers are first-of:

  - ``audit_queue_flush_threshold`` events accumulated (50 by default)
  - ``audit_queue_flush_interval_seconds`` elapsed since last flush (1s)

Per-event memory overhead is small (~200 bytes for an audit dict at the
default sizes), so a 10000-event cap fits in ~2 MiB per worker process —
plenty of headroom over the realistic worst-case storm rate.

Backpressure: the queue is bounded. If writers fill the queue faster
than the flusher drains it (storage-api degraded, or a sustained burst
larger than the cap), new events are dropped with a structured warning
counter rather than blocking the request hot path. Audit is not on the
critical correctness path; loss of a few events under sustained
overload is preferable to defeating the whole point of async ingestion
by blocking writers.

        Slicing protects against two failure modes that a single-call
        flush exposes:

        1. Storage-side hard caps: ``POST /audit-logs/bulk`` rejects
           batches above ``_MAX_BATCH_SIZE`` (500). Without slicing, a
           queue that built up past 500 (storage-api outage,
           tenant-A-storm pile-up) would have its entire drained
           backlog rejected on the first recovery flush.
        2. Per-chunk failure isolation: a bad chunk (one transient
           5xx, one bad event after future relaxations) doesn't take
           down the rest of the drain. Each chunk's success/failure
           is counted independently in ``_flushed_count`` /
           ``_failed_count``.

        Failed chunks are NOT requeued — the closure's failure log
        carries enough detail for an operator to correlate the loss
        with the upstream cause; requeuing would risk an infinite
        retry loop on a sustained outage.

        ``task_done()`` is intentionally NOT called here. The
        documented ``asyncio.Queue.join()`` contract is "wait until
        all enqueued items have been processed" — calling
        ``task_done()`` before the flush would let ``join()`` return
        while events were still buffered in ``events`` and not yet
        written to storage. Nothing in the codebase calls
        ``queue.join()`` today; if a future caller wires it for a
        stricter drain semantic, the right place for ``task_done()``
        is after the per-chunk flush completes successfully (or
        explicitly fails). Today's shutdown path uses ``stop()`` +
        the final ``_drain_and_flush`` call, which doesn't depend on
        the unfinished-task counter at all.
