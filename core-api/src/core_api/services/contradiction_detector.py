"""Detect and resolve contradictions between memories on write.

P1 fixes:
- Post-commit async detection (sees all committed data, no concurrency blind spot)
- Correct supersession semantics (new_memory.supersedes_id -> old memory)
- Broader candidate search (threshold 0.70, limit 8)

Multi-provider support:
- Vertex AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter via provider layer
- Automatic fallback chain: configured provider -> fallback -> heuristic

CONTRADICTION_PROMPT = """\
You are a contradiction detector for a business memory system.

Two statements contradict ONLY IF they make incompatible claims about the
SAME real-world subject. Different subjects -> NOT a contradiction, even if
the predicates look opposite or the statements look semantically similar.

Statement A (NEW): {new_content}

Statement B (EXISTING): {old_content}

Follow these steps in order:

1. Extract subject_a: the entity Statement A is primarily about
   (person, company, project, product, etc.). Use a short noun phrase.
2. Extract subject_b: the entity Statement B is primarily about.
3. Decide same_subject. Set true ONLY when subject_a and subject_b refer
   to the SAME real-world entity. Treat these as same_subject=true:
     - exact name match
     - known alias / nickname / abbreviation of the same entity
     - role description and proper name referring to the same individual
       in context (e.g., "the CEO" and "Sarah Johnson" when context makes
       it unambiguous)
     - pronoun resolved unambiguously to the other statement's subject
   Treat these as same_subject=false:
     - two different people who share a first name or last name
     - two different companies, products, projects, or teams
     - any case where you are not confident the subjects are the same entity
4. Decide non_conflict_reason. Even when same_subject is true, certain
   shapes describe two claims that BOTH hold and so are NOT a
   contradiction. Pick at most one value; pick "none" when the two
   statements really do assert mutually exclusive states.
     - "temporal_supersession": the statements describe sequential
       states of the same subject's lifecycle (planned -> shipped,
       open -> closed, draft -> published, beta -> GA, hired ->
       promoted). The newer state simply supersedes the older one;
       both were true in sequence.
     - "list_valued_predicate": the two statements describe attributes
       of the same subject that do not compete for a single slot.
       Two shapes both qualify:
       (a) one predicate that naturally holds multiple values at the
       same time — "supports English" / "supports French"; speaks
       multiple languages; "reports_to" in matrix orgs; "works_on"
       parallel projects;
       (b) two entirely different attributes of the same subject —
       e.g., "Alice was promoted to Senior Engineer" (her title)
       and "Alice is on the platform team" (her team) are
       complementary facts; both hold simultaneously. Different
       attributes do not exclude each other.
     - "refinement": one statement is a more specific version of the
       other ("Europe" vs "Munich"; "tech" vs "Google"; "Q3" vs
       "September 15"). Both hold; finer granularity does not negate
       coarser.
     - "scope_mismatch": the statements describe the same subject with
       different implicit qualifiers — whole vs part (parent company
       vs division), different time windows (annual vs quarterly), or
       different context qualifiers (weekday vs weekend, work vs
       residence). Both can hold simultaneously.
     - "same_name_distinct_subject": subject_a and subject_b share a
       surface name but plausibly refer to different real-world
       instances (two different builds of "the nightly build", two
       different days of "today's standup", two different people both
       called "John" without disambiguator). This is the symmetric
       complement to same_subject=false for cases where the names
       happen to match.
     - "conditional_unrealized": one statement is conditional /
       hypothetical / irrealis ("if X then Y", "would", "could",
       "might"), and the other is a realised state. The conditional
       does not assert a claim that can contradict.
     - "event_restatement": the two statements describe the SAME
       event with different tense, aspect, or synonymous verbs
       ("acquired" / "is acquiring" the same deal; "was hired" /
       "joined"). They restate the same fact, not different facts.
     - "none": none of the above applies. Use this when the two
       statements really do make incompatible claims about the same
       subject at the same time frame (e.g., "X lives in Tel Aviv"
       vs "X lives in Haifa" as undated current-state claims).
   Two state claims about the same subject are also NOT a
   contradiction when BOTH statements explicitly reference
   non-overlapping past time periods (e.g., "X lived in Tel Aviv
   from 2010 to 2014" vs "X lived in Haifa from 2015 to 2018").
   In that case set non_conflict_reason="scope_mismatch".
5. Decide contradicts:
   - If same_subject is false, contradicts MUST be false.
   - If non_conflict_reason is not "none", contradicts MUST be false.
   - Otherwise contradicts is true only when the two statements assert
     mutually exclusive states about that subject in the same time
     frame. Updates / corrections about the same subject ARE
     contradictions (e.g., "X lives in Tel Aviv" vs "X lives in
     Haifa"). Do not speculate that one statement might describe a
     future state that resolves the conflict — if it does, choose
     temporal_supersession explicitly.

ENTITY_AWARE_CONTRADICTION_PROMPT = """\
You are a contradiction detector for a business memory system, running
the second-pass judgement after entity resolution has already linked
both statements to their canonical entities.

Two statements contradict ONLY IF they make incompatible claims about
the SAME real-world subject. Different subjects -> NOT a contradiction,
even if the predicates look opposite or the statements look semantically
similar.

CRITICAL: Resolved entities below are AUTHORITATIVE. The subject of
each statement has ALREADY been resolved to a specific entity row
(identified by ``entity_id``) by upstream entity extraction. Your job
is NOT to re-do that resolution from raw text; your job is to use the
resolved entities as ground truth and decide whether the two
statements' CLAIMS about those entities are mutually exclusive.

  * If the two RESOLVED-ENTITIES blocks have a subject-role entity with
    the SAME ``entity_id``, the subjects ARE the same real-world entity.
    same_subject MUST be true. Surface text qualifiers ("from X", "at
    Y", "the Z", possessives, role modifiers, employer / team / location
    prefixes) are additional context about that ONE subject, NOT
    evidence of different subjects.

  * If the two RESOLVED-ENTITIES blocks have a subject-role entity with
    DIFFERENT ``entity_id`` values, the subjects are different entity
    rows. same_subject MUST be false, regardless of surface name
    similarity. (Set non_conflict_reason="same_name_distinct_subject"
    when the canonical names happen to match.)

Statement A (NEW): {new_content}
RESOLVED ENTITIES for Statement A:
{new_entities}

Statement B (EXISTING): {old_content}
RESOLVED ENTITIES for Statement B:
{old_entities}

Follow these steps in order:

1. Identify subject_a: from Statement A's resolved entities, the entity
   with role="subject" (or the canonical subject if no role is marked).
   Use its canonical name.
2. Identify subject_b: same from Statement B's resolved entities.
3. Decide same_subject MECHANICALLY by comparing the subject entities'
   ``entity_id`` values (not their surface text). Check the GUARD rules
   first; only fall through to the equality rules if no guard fires.
     - entity_id starts with "<none-" on either side -> same_subject=false
       (entity has no stable identifier; do not infer identity even if
       canonical names happen to match or the two sides happen to
       render the same "<none-..." sentinel string)
     - either side missing a subject-role entity -> same_subject=false
       (degenerate input — this prompt should not have been invoked,
       but if it is, prefer false)
     - same canonical name but different entity_type -> same_subject=false
       (two different real-world things that happen to share a name)
     - subject_a.entity_id == subject_b.entity_id ->  same_subject=true
     - subject_a.entity_id != subject_b.entity_id ->  same_subject=false
   Worked examples:
     (a) Statement A subject: entity_id=ABC123 canonical_name="Priya"
         Statement B subject: entity_id=ABC123 canonical_name="Priya"
         -> same_subject=true even if Statement A says "Priya from
         AcmeCorp" and Statement B says "Priya from BetaIndustries".
         The employer text is additional context about the one resolved
         Priya, not evidence of a different Priya.
     (b) Statement A subject: entity_id=ABC123 canonical_name="Priya"
         Statement B subject: entity_id=XYZ789 canonical_name="Priya"
         -> same_subject=false. Two distinct resolved entities that
         happen to share a canonical name; this is the
         ``same_name_distinct_subject`` non-conflict reason.
4. Decide non_conflict_reason. Even when same_subject is true, certain
   shapes describe two claims that BOTH hold and so are NOT a
   contradiction. Pick at most one value; pick "none" when the two
   statements really do assert mutually exclusive states.
     - "temporal_supersession": sequential states of the same subject's
       lifecycle (planned -> shipped, open -> closed, draft ->
       published, beta -> GA, hired -> promoted). The newer state
       supersedes the older one; both held in sequence.
     - "list_valued_predicate": attributes that do not compete for a
       single slot — multi-value predicates (supports English /
       supports French) or two entirely different attributes of the
       same subject (Alice's title vs Alice's team).
     - "refinement": one statement is a more specific version of the
       other (Europe vs Munich; Q3 vs September 15). Both hold.
     - "scope_mismatch": same subject, different implicit qualifiers
       (whole vs part, different time windows, different contexts).
     - "same_name_distinct_subject": surface names match but the
       resolved entities differ — choose this when you also set
       same_subject=false because the entity blocks disambiguate.
     - "conditional_unrealized": one statement is hypothetical /
       irrealis; conditionals do not contradict realised states.
     - "event_restatement": the two statements describe the SAME event
       with different tense / aspect / synonyms.
     - "none": none of the above; the two statements assert mutually
       exclusive states about the same subject at the same time frame.
5. Decide contradicts:
   - If same_subject is false, contradicts MUST be false.
   - If non_conflict_reason is not "none", contradicts MUST be false.
   - Otherwise contradicts is true only when the two statements assert
     mutually exclusive states about that subject in the same time
     frame. Corrections / updates about the same subject ARE

       must not be flagged. The model classifies the shape into
       ``non_conflict_reason``; any value in ``NON_CONFLICT_REASONS``
       forces ``contradicts=false``. ``"none"`` (or absent / unknown

    is True in Python, so a model returning the *string* "false"

# the judge would see the resolved entity_links and answer a different,
# entity-aware question than Path A's semantic similarity check. In
# practice ``_attempt_path_c_retraction`` calls ``_llm_contradiction_check
# (new_content, old_content, ...)`` with the SAME prompt and SAME inputs
# as Path A's semantic judge. There is no entity context in the request
# — it is the same LLM call rolled twice.
#
# Wet-tested on memclaw.net 2026-05-26 (S2 race probe, scripts/
# repro_contradictions_race.py). Two memories with directly conflicting
# release dates about a synthetic proper-noun subject. Path A correctly
# flagged the conflict; Path C's independent roll returned
# ``(verdict=False, confidence=0.60)`` on a non-trivial fraction of runs
# and silently retracted the correct flag. Confidence rubric:
#   0.90 — clean LLM agreement (both gates aligned on "not contradict")
#   0.85 — gate 2 fired (model named a non_conflict_reason)
#   0.60 — gate 1 fired (model said contradicts=True same_subject=False;
#          parser overrode). THIS IS THE STOCHASTIC FLIP CASE.
#   0.50 — malformed / heuristic fallback
#
# Raising the floor to 0.90 means retraction only fires on clean
# agreement — both gates of the parser say "not a contradiction" with
# no parser-override. Gate-1 (the stochastic-flip case) and gate-2
# (single-gate non_conflict_reason) both now leave Path A's verdict in
# place. This is the "quick fix" tier; the deeper fix (an entity-aware
# prompt that actually receives entity_links + canonical names) is
# tracked separately and will revisit this threshold once the judge has
# a different question to answer.
