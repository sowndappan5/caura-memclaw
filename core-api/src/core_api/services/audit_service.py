"""Audit-event ingestion entrypoint.

``log_action`` is the only public surface — every memory mutation calls
it via the configured ``ServiceHooks`` (see ``core_api.app.lifespan``).

CAURA-628 (2026-04-29): the legacy shape POSTed one audit event per
mutation directly to ``core-storage-api``. Under bulk storms that
created up to N HTTP-POSTs-per-bulk-create on the storage-api connection
pool + serialised tenant B's audit traffic behind tenant A's storm at
the AlloyDB ``audit_log`` table-level write lock. ``log_action`` now
enqueues into a process-local ``AuditEventQueue``; a background flusher
batches events and writes them via ``POST /audit-logs/bulk``.

The synchronous-POST fallback path runs when the queue is not active
(early startup, tests that didn't wire it, intentional kill-switch via
``set_audit_queue(None)``). That fallback preserves the legacy
behaviour byte-for-byte so a queue-side bug can't silently drop audit
events; an operator can fall back to the legacy path during an incident
without a redeploy.
