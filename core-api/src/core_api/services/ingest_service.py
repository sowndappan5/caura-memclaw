CHUNKING_PROMPT = """\
Extract discrete, atomic facts from the following content for storage in an
agent's long-term memory. Each fact must stand on its own when retrieved
later without the surrounding document.
{breadcrumb_instruction}
## Rules

1. **Self-contained.** Every fact must be understandable without the original
   document. Resolve pronouns, references, and "the" + ambiguous noun against
   the document. "He shipped it" is bad; "Bob shipped v2.3 of the SDK on
   March 15" is good.

2. **Atomic.** One claim per fact. A sentence containing "X happened and Y
   was decided" becomes two facts unless one of them is trivial.

3. **No duplicates or near-duplicates.** If the document repeats a claim,
   emit it once. If two paragraphs say the same thing in different words,
   emit it once. Better to under-extract than to clone.

4. **Substantive only.** At least 5 words per fact. No UI labels ("Learn
   more", "Subscribe"), no headings ("Section 3"), no boilerplate ("All
   rights reserved"), no questions, no TODOs without an answer.

5. **No meta-facts.** Do not describe the input itself. Avoid claims like
   "The content begins with...", "The provided text says...", "This
   document is about...". Extract facts FROM the content, not facts ABOUT
   the content.

6. **Salience score** (0.0 to 1.0). Rate how essential each fact is for
   later recall. Use this scale:
     - 1.0 = critical, would be sorely missed if absent
     - 0.7 = useful specifics: names, numbers, dates, decisions, outcomes
     - 0.5 = relevant but not load-bearing
     - 0.3 = arguably extractable but mostly noise
     - 0.0 = filler / restatement
   Be honest. Anything below 0.5 will be dropped automatically.

7. **memory_type.** Pick the most specific tag. When in doubt prefer the
   left option in each pair:
     - fact         — a stable proposition about the world ("Iron melts at 1538°C")
     - decision     — a chosen course of action by an identified actor
     - task         — work item assigned but not yet finished
     - plan         — intended future action stated as plan
     - outcome      — past event/result; if you'd write "X happened" or "Y
                      was completed", use this (not "fact")
     - preference   — a stated like/dislike
     - intention    — what someone aims to do
     - commitment   — explicit promise
     - action       — something done (granular than outcome)
     - episode      — narrative event tied to a specific moment
     - semantic     — definitional/conceptual relationship
     - cancellation — explicit revocation of a prior plan/commitment

## Quantity guidance

Extract 5-20 facts depending on content length. Err toward fewer, higher-
salience facts over many low-salience ones.

## Content

{content}

## Output

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with a "facts" key. Each item:

    Three correctness/quality moves over the original loop:

    1. **Strong write_mode** (P1.3). Each ``MemoryCreate`` carries
       ``write_mode="strong"``, forcing the inline enrichment path so
       title/tags/weight are populated synchronously. Previously these
       went out via the fast path's deferred-enrichment queue, which
       isn't consumed in some deployments — leaving memories with
       ``title=null`` indefinitely.

    2. **Pre-loop content-hash dedup** (P1.4). Before any enrichment
       LLM call, batch-query existing content hashes for this tenant.
       Facts whose hash already exists short-circuit straight into
       ``skipped_duplicates``. Without this gate, every duplicate
       paid a full strong-mode LLM round-trip before being rejected
       with a 409 inside ``create_memory`` — pure waste on overlap-
       heavy batches (the common re-ingest case).

    3. **Bounded-parallel writes** (P1.3). Survivors go through
       ``create_memory`` concurrently with ``Semaphore(_COMMIT_CONCURRENCY)``
       Strong-mode runs a real OpenAI enrichment per fact (~2s); without
       parallelism, 10 facts is 20s+. ``tenant_config`` is pre-warmed
       once so the per-fact pipeline reuses the cache instead of racing
